MACD Strategy Implementation:
https://github.com/ddcc7/crypto-market-intelligence/commit/d1fdb2c

Added MACD functionality to crypto_analytics.py with three core functions:
1. calculate_macd(): MACD line (EMA diff), Signal line, Histogram
2. generate_macd_signals(): Trading signals on crossovers
3. backtest_macd_strategy(): Multi-timeframe testing

2-year backtest results (BTC, ETH, XRP):
- Standard MACD (12/26/9): ETH best at +90.44%
- Fast MACD (8/17/9): More trades, lower returns
- Slow MACD (19/39/9): ETH leads at +118.24%, 0.98 Sharpe

Results in predictions.json show slow MACD's superior performance in trending markets.
