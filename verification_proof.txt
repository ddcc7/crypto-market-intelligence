https://github.com/ddcc7/crypto-market-intelligence/commit/f72daba (December 5, 2024 23:34:43 CET)

Files and functions added:
1. crypto_analytics.py:
   - calculate_stochastic(): Computes %K (fast) and %D (slow) lines
   - generate_stochastic_signals(): Creates signals on crossovers
   - compare_all_strategies(): Includes Stochastic vs MA comparison

Results in predictions.json:
Fast Stochastic (5/3):
- Total Return: +358.14%
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.48
- Trading Activity: 41 signals
- Outperformed all MA strategies

Standard settings comparison:
- Stochastic (14/3): -100.00% return, 28 trades
- WMA: +192.55% return, 4 trades
- EMA: +127.77% return, 4 trades
- SMA: +150.54% return, 4 trades

Implementation uses standard Stochastic Oscillator methodology with configurable %K/%D periods and overbought/oversold thresholds.
