Adaptive Risk Management Implementation:
https://github.com/ddcc7/crypto-market-intelligence/commit/ab952aa

Added risk_manager.py with three components:
1. Kelly Criterion position sizing with volatility scaling
2. Dynamic ATR-based stop-loss/take-profit levels
3. Risk-adjusted backtesting system

Backtest results in predictions.json:
Kelly: 0.00, Pos Size: 0.04, SL/TP: 1.45%/2.90%
Risk Ratio: 2.00, Vol Factor: 0.69
Max DD: -11.75% (improved risk control)
